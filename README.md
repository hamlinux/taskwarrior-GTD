##**GTD with Taskwarrior**


#**Introduction**

#**GTD**
Getting Things Done (abbreviated to G.T.D.) is a time management method, described in the book of the same title by productivity consultant David Allen. 
The GTD method rests on the idea of moving planned tasks and projects out of the mind
 by recording them externally and then breaking them into actionable 
work items.  This allows attention to be focused on taking action on 
tasks, instead of  recalling them.

#**Taskwarrior**
Taskwarrior is an open-source, cross platform time and task management tool. It has a command-line interface rather than a graphical user interface.
Taskwarrior uses concepts and techniques described in Getting Things Done by David Allen, but is paradigm-agnostic in that it does not require users to adhere to any given life-management philosophy.  According to its author, Taskwarrior was created "to address layout and feature issues" in the Todo.txt applications popularized by Gina Trapani

#**This Project:**

Uses templates produced by Tom Sydney Kerckhove is a series of blog posts (https://cs-syd.eu/tags/Taskwarrior) about integrating taskwarrior into a specific GTD workflow, modifying reports and creating scripts that are built upon the GTD concepts of:**Collection, Clarifying, Organize, Reflect, Engage**
  
 I have included some of my own reports and aliases to meet my own GTD needs and to make the ability to accomplish these steps as organically as possible without breaking stride in daily life.
 

 The use of tasksh with the review is a great way of doing a GTD weekly review.  Autoclear is set true in .taskrc to clear the screen after each task is reviewed to reduce mental clutter.
 
 The system also integrates with the MUTT email client and script Mutt2task.  Also recommended is **Mutt Wizard**. https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/mutt-wizard

I use this same set up for collection and reflection on the go with my android phone running Termux.
